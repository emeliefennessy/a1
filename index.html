<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);"> 1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</p>
<p> When I first started interacting with the experience, my attention was immediately drawn to the floating buttons. I instinctively tried to press the "x" and "help" buttons, curious to see what actions they would trigger.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);"> 2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
<p></p> During my two-minute interaction with the experience, I engaged in several actions:
    - I attempted to catch and press the floating buttons, anticipating their effects.
    - I clicked on the "cyber monkey," which led me to a new page.
    - I interacted with the light switch in the corner, transitioning the interface to dark mode and revealing a floating ghost.
    - I acquired a key to unlock the "neighbourhood" feature, revealing an abandoned-looking area.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);">3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</p>
    <p> The aspect of the experience that captured most of my time was pressing different buttons and exploring where they would lead. This action resulted in my transition to various new pages, each offering unique content.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);">4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</p>
    <p> The most common action I performed during my two-minute interaction was pressing different buttons, allowing me to navigate through the experience and discover new elements.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);"> 5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</p>
    <p> My impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience was that it was made to create a visually chaotic representation of the internet, encapsulating its unpredictable nature. It also seeks to provide users with a playful and exploratory environment. The experience felt strange, humorous, and mysterious, aiming to offer a space for users to engage in light-hearted exploration and enjoyment.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);"> 6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</p>
    <p> The interactive experience communicates its primary goal through its unconventional layout. It intentionally lacks clear instructions, encouraging users to explore freely without a specific agenda. The use of humorous remarks and imaginative imagery adds to the fun and engaging nature of the experience.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);">7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</p>
    <p> I believe the interactive experience was designed for relatively short-term engagement. While users may spend time exploring and clicking on various elements to uncover surprises, it doesn't seem intended for prolonged interaction. Once users have uncovered most of the content, the novelty might wear off, making it more of a one-time exploration.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);">8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</p>
    <p> The interactive experience guides users in specific directions, requiring certain actions to access different areas. While it may evolve over time with occasional updates, the core interaction pattern is likely to remain consistent.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);"> 9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference? </p>
    <p> The experience references various media forms, including memes, old video game graphics, other small games with links and trailers, and random pages like the "neighbourhood" and dark mode. It draws inspiration from a wide array of sources, creating a collage of internet culture.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);">10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</p>
    <p> These references convey that engaging with the research experience shouldn't be approached with strict logical expectations. Instead, it invites a playful and open-minded attitude. The references suggest that the experience is meant to be a whimsical and enjoyable exploration, rather than a formal or serious endeavour.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);">11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</p>
    <p> The references communicate that the primary emotion is a sense of fun and light-heartedness. They encourage users to embrace the chaos and unpredictability, creating an environment for curiosity and amusement.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);">12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</p>
    <p> The most frustrating aspect of the interaction for me was when I ventured to a new page, explored its contents, but then struggled to return to the original page. The lack of a clear navigation system made it challenging to backtrack efficiently, forcing me to refresh the page and start over. This navigation issue stopped the smooth flow of exploration.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(146, 228, 153);">13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?
</p>
    <p>  The messages that popped up when I clicked on various elements were immensely satisfying. Their humour and unexpected nature added an element of surprise to the experience. Additionally, I found the overall chaos and messiness of the interface oddly satisfying. Navigating through this digital mishmash was both entertaining and intriguing, with each click revealing something new and unique.</p>
